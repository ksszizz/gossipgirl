      <h2>Limo Confessions</h2>
      <p>First night back from boarding school and already scandal? Blair Waldorf and Chuck Bass, same limo, too many whispers. Ten minutes later, she exits with her lipstick slightly faded and her confidence fully restored. Word is, the Palace Hotel staff saw more than they should have — and one of them is talking...</p>

      <h2>Breakfast at Betrayal’s</h2>
      <p>Serena van der Woodsen, alone at Sant Ambroeus, waiting for Nate Archibald. But when Nate finally walked in, he wasn’t alone. Her smile vanished faster than the foam on her latte. Some say it was an old flame, others claim it was just a “friend.” But when it comes to Serena, nothing’s ever just friendly...</p>

      <h2>B vs S: Round Infinity</h2>
      <p>Two queens, one crown. Serena and Blair both arrived at Eleanor Waldorf’s afterparty wearing the same couture gown. A spilled martini, a sharp whisper, and one shattered friendship later — the Met Steps will never feel the same. The real question: who leaked the guest list?</p>

      <h2>Dan’s Dirty Draft</h2>
      <p>Dan Humphrey’s new story is lighting up NYU, but not for its prose. Seems his “fictional” blonde sounds a lot like Serena, and the mysterious playboy? Ring a Bass-shaped bell? If Lonely Boy keeps airing dirty laundry, he might find himself washed out of the Upper East Side altogether...</p>

      <h2>Serena’s Sunset Scene</h2>
      <p>Golden girl S spotted in the Hamptons, watching the sunset alone, rosé in hand and a tear in her eye. Rumor has it, her latest flame flickered out after a very public argument. But don’t feel too bad — heartbreak never stopped Serena from finding her next spark...</p>

      <h2>Nate the Great Escape</h2>
      <p>Nate Archibald seen boarding a Montauk yacht, solo and suspiciously silent. Sources whisper he’s running from a scandal — one involving family money, a missing bracelet, and a senator’s daughter. If Nate thinks the ocean will wash away the truth, he’s in for a rude awakening...</p>

      <h2>The Empire State of Scandal</h2>
      <p>Chuck Bass threw another rooftop bash at The Empire. But by midnight, the music stopped — and so did the fun. One guest left crying, another left furious, and Chuck? He just smiled. There’s a reason they call him the devil in a bow tie...</p>

      <h2>The Brooklyn Bounce-Back</h2>
      <p>Dan Humphrey traded penthouses for paintbrushes, seen in Dumbo with a mysterious artist muse. Maybe he’s looking for “authenticity.” Or maybe he’s hiding from a certain Upper East Side blonde. Either way, Serena’s silence speaks louder than any rejection letter...</p>

      <h2>Diamonds &amp; DMs</h2>
      <p>Little J’s new jewelry line shines — maybe too bright. Sources say Carter Baizen funded the launch. Generosity, or guilt? Jenny’s been quiet since, but her DMs? Full of danger and opportunity. A diamond may be forever, but a deal like this could crack her empire wide open...</p>

      <h2>B’s Secret Bloom</h2>
      <p>Queen B, shopping for baby-blue booties at Bergdorf’s? Word on Madison Avenue says she’s expecting. But is it love, or leverage? If there’s one thing Blair knows, it’s how to turn whispers into weapons — and this rumor could crown her the queen of them all...</p>

      <h2>Chuck’s Charity Case</h2>
      <p>Chuck Bass donates a million to a children’s hospital — hours after a scandal breaks about his latest conquest. Redemption arc or PR stunt? Knowing Chuck, both. But here’s the twist: the woman behind the donation isn’t who you think...</p>

      <h2>The Final Comeback</h2>
      <p>One last blast before the ball drops. Serena and Blair side by side on the Palace rooftop, truce or trap? As the clock struck midnight, every phone in Manhattan lit up: “Did you miss me?” Guess who’s back for one final secret...</p>
