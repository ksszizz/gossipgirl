        <img src="../pictures/characters/serena.jpg" alt="Serena van der Woodsen" title="Serena van der Woodsen">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Serena van der Woodsen</h2>
            <p>The IT girl of the Upper East Side — effortlessly glamorous, unpredictable, and magnetic. Serena’s beauty and charm draw everyone in, but her impulsive choices and tangled relationships keep her life anything but perfect. She’s always chasing freedom… and sometimes running from her past.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Some girls are born to stand out."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/blair.jpg" alt="Blair Waldorf" title="Blair Waldorf">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Blair Waldorf</h2>
            <p>Queen B — ambitious, stylish, and razor-sharp. Blair is the definition of Upper East Side royalty, ruling Constance Billard with her signature headbands and scheming smile. Beneath the perfectionism and power plays lies a dreamer who believes in true love, destiny, and a perfect fairytale ending.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Destiny is for losers."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/chuck.jpg" alt="Chuck Bass" title="Chuck Bass">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Chuck Bass</h2>
            <p>The bad boy billionaire with a dangerous charm. Chuck is indulgent, complicated, and heartbreakingly human beneath his designer suits. He hides pain behind power and pleasure — but when it comes to love, especially Blair, he’s willing to risk everything. </p>
            <p class="quote">"I'm Chuck Bass."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/nate.jpg" alt="Nate Archibald" title="Nate Archibald">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Nate Archibald</h2>
            <p>The golden boy with a heart of gold. Nate’s charm and looks make him everyone’s dream, but he’s more than a rich kid — he’s loyal, honest, and constantly searching for purpose beyond privilege. Always caught between love and loyalty, Nate stays true to his moral compass.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I'm not a bad guy</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/dan.jpg" alt="Dan Humphrey" title="Dan Humphrey">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Dan Humphrey</h2>
            <p>The Lonely Boy, who dared to enter the Upper East Side world. Smart, introspective, and often judgmental, Dan is both observer and participant — trying to fit into a society he claims to despise. His words cut deep, whether in his writing or his secret identity.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Every story starts with an outsider."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/jenny.jpg" alt="Jenny Humphrey" title="Jenny Humphrey">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Jenny Humphrey</h2>
            <p>Little J who traded innocence for ambition. Jenny started as a dreamer with a sewing machine and ended up fighting for a place among Manhattan’s elite. She’s talented, fearless, and willing to risk everything for the crown — but the higher she climbs, the more she learns that power always comes at a price.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I'm not a little girl anymore."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/vanessa.jpg" alt="Vanessa Abrams" title="Vanessa Abrams">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Vanessa Abrams</h2>
            <p>The Brooklyn girl with an artist’s soul and a rebel’s heart. Vanessa sees the Upper East Side for what it really is — beautiful, ruthless, and impossible to ignore. She wants truth in a world built on lies, but even she can’t resist getting pulled into the glittering chaos she once judged.</p>
            <p class="quote">"I see the world they pretend to live in."</p>
        </div>
        </div>

        <div class="character">
        <img src="../pictures/characters/georgina.jpg" alt="Georgina Sparks" title="Georgina Sparks">
        <div class="desc">
            <h2>Georgina Sparks</h2>
            <p>The storm you never see coming. Georgina is unpredictable, wickedly intelligent, and terrifyingly charming. She thrives on chaos and always shows up when things are about to explode. Love her or fear her — she’s the kind of girl who doesn’t need an invitation to the party; she is the party.</p>
            <p class="quote">"Sweetheart, I am the scandal."</p>
        </div>
